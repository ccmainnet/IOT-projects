# Heads or Tails
This project is one of my first projects following courses in IvanOnTech Academy C++
The project simulates Heads or Tails game. After starting the game player must select H(eads) OR T(ails). After showing the result of the flip of the coin, player is asked to play again or end the game.
## Description
Made two versions of the "game" The first (Heads or Tails) with code written out.
The second one (headsortails_functions) same program only with more functions and room for improvement ;)
## Installation
There is no installation involved as this is just code
## Usage
To execute the code use xcode or any other suitable editor (for C++) to execute.
## Features
It doesn't have a lot of features, just start the program, choose H(eads) or T(ails) and choose Y if you want to try again or play again and choose N to stop playing.
